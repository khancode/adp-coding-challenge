The goal is to develop a simple web application to maintain employee contact information for several employers.
This information should be manageable directly through a user interface, as well as calling the web application directly using APIs.  
Be as creative as youâ€™d like. Using MEAN stack as a reference architecture, develop a web application with the following characteristics:
- Provide a user interface for managing employee contact information.
- Access to the information must require a single shared password.
- Support an interface that allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting an employee.
* Note that the use of Angular is not mandatory for this exercise.
